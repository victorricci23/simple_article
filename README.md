A clean and responsive article listing page built with pure HTML and CSS. It displays a header title, a decorative separator, and a list of tech-related articles with thumbnail images, titles, and dates. The layout adapts smoothly to mobile, tablet, and desktop screens using media queries and flexbox.

### What I learned

- How to create a fully responsive card-based layout using **Flexbox** (both row and column directions) and **media queries**.
- Effective use of **CSS custom properties** could be added in the future, but here I focused on direct styling with good spacing and typography hierarchy.
- Practiced mobile-first responsive design by handling image scaling, font size adjustments, and layout direction changes (row → column) at smaller breakpoints.
- Improved semantic HTML usage (article, section, header) and accessibility considerations (alt text on images).

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs - Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox) - Great reference for understanding flex properties and alignment.
- [Google Fonts - Poppins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins) - Clean, modern sans-serif font that works perfectly for tech-related content.
- [devChallenges.io Simple Article Listing](https://devchallenges.io/challenge/simple-article-listing) - The original challenge with design reference.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties (potential future improvement)
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid (not used here, but flex handles it well)
- Media Queries for responsive design
- Google Fonts (Poppins)

## Features

- Responsive layout that switches from side-by-side (image + text) on desktop to stacked (image on top) on mobile
- Centered content with maximum width constraints for better readability
- Consistent typography using Poppins font across headings, dates, and footer
- Simple decorative separator bar
- Clean author attribution in the footer with links

This application/site was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges-dashboard) challenge.
